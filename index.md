## Welcome to the Personal Pages of Yi Liu 
# Personal Information
I am currently working at Changzhou University, Changzhou, China. I recieved my Ph. D. degree from Xidian University in December 2019. From September 2018 to September 2019, I was funded by CSC as a visiting student in Lancaster University and Warick University.

# Research Interest
My current research interest convers computer vision and machine learning, including salient object detection, camoufalged object detection, capsule network, 3D poind cloud, etc.
